`:Pounce`                                                             *:Pounce*
    Begin an incremental search. Type the character at the destination and
    Pounce will highlight all matches on screen. Next, refine the matches by
    typing more characters (in order) that are present after the destination.
    The fuzzy search algorithm will find the best match which will be
    highlighed in green. Other matches will be highlighted in orange. You can
    hit enter to accept the match and jump to it, or C-j/C-k to scroll through
    the matches. Escape cancels the motion and leaves the cursor at its previous
    position.
