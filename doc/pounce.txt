`:Pounce`                                                             *:Pounce*
    Begin an incremental search. Type the character at the destination and
    Pounce will highlight all matches on screen. Next, refine the matches by
    typing more characters (in order) that are present after the destination.
    The first letter of the match will be replaced with an uppercase "accept
    key". You can hit that key to jump to the match, or continue refining the
    search. Escape cancels the motion and leaves the cursor at its previous
    position.
